3.1. EfficientNet B0
\hfill \break
EfficientNet architecture consists of seven blocks which are shown in different colours. The basic building block of EfficientNet-B0 is a mobile inverted bottleneck convolution (MBConv), while each MBConv block is shown with the corresponding kernel filter size [6]. The figure below shows the different block
