\section{Abstract}
Classifying mushrooms is an important taks with many applications in ecological studies, public health, and the culinary arts. In this work, we provide a novel method for improving the categorization of mushrooms into poisonous or edible. Approach of transfer learning was utlized and EfficientNetB0 architecture was choosen. We acquire datasets, perform thorough preprocessing, construct models, and optimize hyperparameters as part of our technique. By using transfer learning, we improved the pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model's classification accuracy by methodically fine tuning the hyper-parameter for optimum result.
We found an ideal model configuration through repeated trying and testing, which greatly enhanced classification performance, especially in properly recognizing dangerous mushrooms.
